<h2><strong>A_Portrait_Moody_Me_Sarah</strong></h2>
    <p>To interact with my portrait, you can click on your mouse to change my outfit.</p>
    <p>You can also make my cheeks blush, and my hair is actively changing.</p>
    <p>You can also see each coordinate with your mouse which I got inspired from one our classmates,/p>
    <p>I also do this on my sketches because it is really helpful.</p>
    <p>I was also doing some trial and error with making my mouse have a heart when you drag it but it got messed up.</p>
    <p>(It was the same heart that was in my hair, but I put "If (mouseX,MouseY)" above it.)</p>
    <p>I just left the one seen in my hair because the mouse one stopped working once I added the changing mouse press for my turtleneck/sweater I am wearing.)</p>
